- 👋 Hi, I’m @robmanganelly. I started coding in 2019, Python was my first language. Today, I'm more focused on JS/TS, but open to other languages like JAVA/Kotlin/Go if needed.  
- 👀 I’m interested in creating web products, but also native applications (Android mostly). I like both small and complex projects, and can work both sides of the stack.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about everything I can, but more focused on JS frameworks and Docker/Kubernetes
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web project using Angular/React/Node
- 📫 How to reach me : email me to robmanganelly@gmail.com
