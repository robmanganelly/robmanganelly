- 👋 Hi, I’m @robmanganelly. I'm a software engineer working for Akamai Technologies.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating web products, but also native applications (mobile mostly). I like both small and complex projects, and can work both sides of the stack. I specialize on UI, mostly using Angular, but also have some experience with Flutter/Dart.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about everything, so this is not a thing I could relate with much detail, everything that comes to my hand is analyzed and studied. I am an ehthusiastic learner.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web project 
- My skillset is always expanding, but my main skill is solving problems, regardless of the language. However I know couple languages/tools like:
  - Python
  - Javascript
  - Typescript
  - Dart
  - Go
  - nodejs
  - Angular
  - React
  - Docker
