- 👋 Hi, I’m @robmanganelly. I'm a Front End Developer, mostly focused on Angular, but I love to experiment with other languages and technologies. 
- 👀 I’m interested in creating web products, but also native applications (Android mostly). I like both small and complex projects, and can work both sides of the stack.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about everything I can, but more focused on Web Development and Docker/Kubernetes. Also started playing with Flutter.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web project using Angular/React/Node/Express/MongoDB
- 📫 How to reach me : visit my page <https://robmanganelly.dev> or email me to robmanganelly@gmail.com
